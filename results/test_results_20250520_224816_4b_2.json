MSE measures the average difference between the predicted values and the actual values squared.\n\nExplanation:\n\nMean Squared Error (MSE) is a metric that quantifies the average of the squares of the errors or differences between the predicted values and the actual values. It provides a measure of how well the model's predictions match the actual data.\n\n29. **Question 6 (6 points)**\n\nConsider a binary classification problem where a machine learning model is trained to classify data points into two categories: positive (1) or negative (0). Which of the following tables most likely represents the confusion matrix for evaluating the performance of the classifier?\n\n|                  | Predicted Positive (1) | Predicted Negative (0) |\n|------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Actual Positive (1)| TP                        | FP                       |\n| Actual Negative (0)| FN                        | TN                        |\n\nA. Predicted Positive (1) -> True Positive, Predicted Negative (0) -> False Positive\n\nB. Predicted Positive (1) -> True Positive, Predicted Negative (0) -> False Negative\n\nC. Predicted Positive (1) -> True Negative, Predicted Negative (0) -> False Negative\n\nD. Predicted Positive (1) -> False Negative, Predicted Negative (0) -> True Negative\n\n**Answer 6 (6 points):**\n\nA. Predicted Positive (1) -> True Positive, Predicted Negative (0) -> False Positive\n\nExplanation:\n\nA confusion matrix is a table used to describe the performance of a classification model on a set of test data for which the true values are known. Each column in the confusion matrix represents the instances in a predicted class while each row represents the instances in an actual class. The key elements in a confusion matrix are:\n\n- True"
